    <h3 id="childhood">Simple but Weird Childhood Experience</h3>
    <p>My childhood was simple and quiet. My mother and father lived with me in my grandmother’s house. Life felt ordinary during those early years. After some time, we moved into a new apartment. At first, we felt relief and comfort in our new home. However, we later realized that the apartment was haunted by crying ghosts. The strange experiences slowly became more disturbing as time passed. Some nights were filled with fear and confusion. After two years, we decided to move again to escape the hauntings. Unfortunately, something more sinister appeared there. It felt like a devil-like creature was present in the house. One day, we took a family picture together, and the creature appeared in the photo as a dark shadow. The image looked corrupted, as if the phone itself was affected. We were terrified and could not stay any longer in that place. After one year, we moved into our current house, where the strange experiences finally stopped. I also remember playing outside with my childhood friends and enjoying traditional games. Everything changed when the internet was introduced into my life, and online gaming became my main hobby.</p>

    <h3 id="teenage">My Peak Teenage Years</h3>
    <p>My teenage years were shaped by my introverted personality. I found it difficult to communicate with other people, especially when they did not match my vibe. Because of this, I often stayed quiet and kept to myself. Over time, I realized that I needed to try communicating with others because no man is an island. Another major part of my teenage life was my attitude toward studying. During high school, I barely studied and felt satisfied with just passing grades. I often slept in class and did only what was necessary. Everything changed when I entered senior high school. I became disciplined and serious about my studies, eventually becoming a consistent honor student. This transformation felt incredibly fulfilling and motivating.</p>

    <h3 id="college">College Experience Towards the Future</h3>
    <p>My college experience was rough at the beginning. Everything felt overwhelming, especially coming from being an honor student to barely maintaining good grades. The new school system, professors, and classmates required constant adjustment. I struggled at the start of every semester but slowly improved over time. I chose UE because it is well known for IT and Computer Science and recognized as a Center of Excellence. The program was much harder compared to others, but it taught me valuable lessons such as starting projects early and adapting quickly. These experiences helped prepare me for future job opportunities and shaped a more disciplined IT lifestyle. I am truly grateful to my parents for their support.</p>
